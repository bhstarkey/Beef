# BellyButtonBacteria

The purpose of our analysis was to give volunteers who allowed the scientists to collect bacteria from their belly buttons, an easy way to navigate and see the results of their sample. It also gave the scientists an easy way to navigate through the data, and show which bacteria they could test to find one that fit their needs.
